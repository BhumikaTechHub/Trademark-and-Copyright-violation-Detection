# AI Logo Verification Project 

This project uses AI and image processing techniques to verify the authenticity of brand logos by comparing original and fake logos.

## Files

- `PRJ2.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook implementing the project logic.
- `Dataset.zip`: Contains original and fake logo images used for training and evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- ORB Feature Matching
- Siamese Neural Network (Keras)
- SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
- Euclidean Distance

## Features

- Image similarity scoring using SSIM and ORB
- Siamese neural network for logo classification
- Evaluation metrics and results

## How to Run

1. Unzip `Dataset.zip`.
2. Open `PRJ2.ipynb` in Jupyter/Colab.
3. Run all cells to see results.

## Future Improvements

- Add UI using Gradio/Streamlit
- Expand to multi-brand detection
- Use CLIP or Vision Transformers
